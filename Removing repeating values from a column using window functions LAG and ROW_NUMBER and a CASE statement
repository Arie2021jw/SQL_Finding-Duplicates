Exercise #1: Remove repeating values from a column.


Solution #1: We remove repeating values from a column using window functions LAG and ROW_NUMBER and a CASE statement.

Tables used:
1) [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]
2) [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory]
3) [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Department]
4) [AdventureWorks2022].[Person].[Person]

	Query #1: We create a new column for DepartmentName that shows each department name only once
	---------
SELECT UniqueDepartmentName.NewDepartmentName								-- UniqueDepartmentNameLevel4
,  UniqueDepartmentName.FirstName
,  UniqueDepartmentName.MiddleName
,  UniqueDepartmentName.LastName
FROM (
	SELECT		-- RemovingDepartmentNamesLevel3
	RemovingDepartmentNames.DepartmentID
	, LAG(RemovingDepartmentNames.DepartmentName) OVER (ORDER BY RemovingDepartmentNames.DepartmentName) AS LAGDepartmentNumber
	, RemovingDepartmentNames.DepartmentName
	, CASE WHEN LAG(RemovingDepartmentNames.DepartmentName) OVER (ORDER BY RemovingDepartmentNames.DepartmentName) = RemovingDepartmentNames.DepartmentName THEN ''
			ELSE RemovingDepartmentNames.DepartmentName
			END AS NewDepartmentName
	, RemovingDepartmentNames.FirstName
	, RemovingDepartmentNames.MiddleName
	, RemovingDepartmentNames.LastName
		FROM (
		SELECT OriginalTables.BusinessEntityID							-- RemovingDuplicatesLevel2
		, OriginalTables.DepartmentID	
		, OriginalTables.DepartmentName
		, OriginalTables.FirstName
		, OriginalTables.MiddleName

			, Employee.BusinessEntityID	
			, EmployeeDepartmentHistory.DepartmentID
			, Department.[Name] AS DepartmentName
			, ISNULL(Person.FirstName, '') AS [FirstName]
			, ISNULL(Person.MiddleName, '') AS [MiddleName]

		) AS OriginalTables
		WHERE OriginalTables.RowNumberRemovingDuplicates = 1					-- RemovingDuplicatesLevel2
	) AS RemovingDepartmentNames									-- RemovingDepartmentNamesLevel3
) AS UniqueDepartmentName										-- UniqueDepartmentNameLevel4
ORDER BY UniqueDepartmentName.DepartmentID, UniqueDepartmentName.FirstName

Below are the queries used step-by-step for this solution.

	Query #1.1: We remove the duplicated BusinessEntityIDs for the employees that changed departments, in order to retrieve the list of (unique BusinessEntityIDs) employees
	-----------

To get our desired result, we proceed to:
a) remove column LAGDepartmentNumber, 
b) remove column DepartmentName, 
c) we sort the query ORDER BY UniqueDepartmentName.DepartmentID, UniqueDepartmentName.FirstName

See Query #1 showing the desired result.
