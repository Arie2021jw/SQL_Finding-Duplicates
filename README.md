This repository contains multiple examples on how SQL Server can be used to manipulate duplicated records.

List of examples:
1) Concatenating different addresses located on separate rows associated to one BusinessEntityID into one row
2) Finding duplicate records on multiple tables
3) Finding the list of employees with odd numbers on column BusinessEntityID
4) Update Pivoting every department name under its respective (department) group name by turning rows into columns
5) Pivoting the number of employees by department into a single row using ROW_NUMBER (window) function, aggregation functions and CASE statements
