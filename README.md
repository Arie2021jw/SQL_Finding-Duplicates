This repository contains 4 folders that have multiple examples on how SQL Server can be used to work with data:
1) Hierarchical parent-child relationship
2) Pivoting
3) String manipulation
4) Data sets



Below is the list of examples for each folder.

Folder #1: Hierarchical parent-child relationship:
1) Finding the manager for each employee (Parent-Child relationship)


Folder #2: Pivoting
1) Pivoting employee count by department name
2) Pivoting multiple department names under same group name
3) Pivoting query results for year-to-year comparison of sales
4) Reverse pivoting a query's result (multiple columns) into only one column
5) Reverse pivoting employee count by department (columns into rows)


Folder #3: String manipulation
1) Alphabetize the individual characters within a string
2) Convert delimited lists by commas into lists to use on IN clause
3) Create delimited lists by commas from table rows
4) Parsing through a string to retrieve each character on a different row
5) Parsing through a string while changing the parameters of SUBSTRING function
6) Sorting a column having mixed AlphaNumeric values
7) Sorting a column having strings having only letters


Folder #4: Data sets
1) Concatenating multiple addresses for a BusinessEntityID into one row
2) Dividing vendors into 10 groups based on historical purchasing amounts
3) Finding beginning and end of a range of consecutive numbers
4) Finding duplicate records on multiple tables
5) Finding employees with odd numbers on column BusinessEntityID
6) Finding the manager for each employee (Parent-Child relationship)
7) Generate lists of consecutives numeric values
