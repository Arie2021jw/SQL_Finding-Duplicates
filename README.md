This repository contains multiple examples on how SQL Server can be used to work with data sets.

List of examples:
1) Concatenating multiple addresses for a BusinessEntityID into one row
2) Finding beginning and end of a range of consecutive numbers
3) Finding duplicate records on multiple tables
4) Finding employees with odd numbers on column BusinessEntityID
5) Finding the manager for each employee (Parent-Child relationship)
6) Pivoting employee count by department name
7) Pivoting multiple department names under same group name
8) Pivoting query results for year-to-year comparison of sales
9) Removing repeating values from a column
10) Reverse pivoting a query's result (multiple columns) into only one column
11) Reverse pivoting employee count by department (columns into rows)
