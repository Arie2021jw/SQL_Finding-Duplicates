This repository contains multiple examples on how SQL Server can be used to work with data sets.

List of examples:
1) Concatenating multiple addresses for a BusinessEntityID into one row
2) Finding duplicate records on multiple tables
3) Finding employees with odd numbers on column BusinessEntityID
4) Finding the manager for each employee (Parent-Child relationship)
5) Pivoting employee count by department name
6) Pivoting multiple department names under same group name
7) Pivoting query results for year-to-year comparison of sales
8) Removing repeating values from a column
9) Reverse pivoting a query's result (multiple columns) into only one column
10) Reverse pivoting employee count by department (columns into rows)
