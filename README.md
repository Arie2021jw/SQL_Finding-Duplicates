This repository contains multiple examples on how SQL Server can be used to manipulate duplicated records.

List of examples:
1) Concatenating multiple addresses for a BusinessEntityID into one row
2) Finding duplicate records on multiple tables
3) Finding employees with odd numbers on column BusinessEntityID
4) Pivoting employee count by department name
5) Pivoting multiple department names under same group name
6) Pivoting query results for year-to-year comparison of sales
7) Removing repeating values from a column
8) Reverse pivoting a query's result (multiple columns) into only one column
9) Reverse pivoting employee count by department (columns into rows)
